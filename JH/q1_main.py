# the following function is used for answer checking  

# It calls your function 10000 times and shows the frequency that a particular number appears on your simulated die
# because of the random number generation, a slight variation in frequency is acceptable.
# For example, if loaded_die() has been properly written, the number 1 will appear ~50% of the time, 
# and the remaining numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) will appear ~10% of the time. 
# A slight deviation is acceptable. For example, "1" has a frequency of 49.5-50.5% is fine.
# The frequencies for 0, 7, 8 and 9 should be 0%.
